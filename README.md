- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old
- and still perfectly edible. The long shelf life of honey is attributed to its low water content and acidic pH, creating an environment that is
- inhospitable to bacteria and microorganisms. So, honey you find today might be just as delicious as the honey enjoyed by ancient civilizations! 🍯✨
